This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app).

## React App

### Preparation

You have to run `yarn` to install dependencies and create `.env` file with `.env.example` to run scripts. 

In the project directory, then you can run:

#### `yarn react-app:storybook`

Runs the Storybook React.<br>
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings on the browser.

#### `yarn react-app:start`

Runs the React app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

#### `yarn react-app:test`

Runs the React test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

#### `yarn react-app:build`

Builds the React app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the React documentation on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
